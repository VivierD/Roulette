<h1 align="center">Elimination Wheel project</h1>

![](image.png)

<p align="center">This little side project was inspired by an evening with a friend. When we couldn't agree on which film to choose, we decided to let a wheel the last word. Not wanting the classic wheel system, in order to spice up the selection we looked an elimination system. Finding nothing on the web, I submit this project today.</p>
